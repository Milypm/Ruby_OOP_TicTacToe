# OOP with Ruby: Tic-Tac-Toe game

> In this project we created a game emulating the classic 'Tic Tac Toe'.
It is made to run on the terminal/command line, and interacts with the user.
The file (main) is executable, so it can run easily.

## Built With
- Ruby
- Rubocop
- Git

## How to run it
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.
* If you're using latest version of git.
* Clone this url [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://github.com/Milypm/Ruby_OOP_TicTacToe.git) on your local host.
* Unzip and open the folder that contains the main.rb file and run the command line in terminal:
-Run irb
-Type: main.rb (if you are already on the 'bin' folder, if not type: bin/main.rb)
* The program (game) should display now on the terminal

## Game rules
- Each player needs a unique name to identify them.
- A player is assigned a unique symbol that is either 'X' or 'O'.
- A player should choose a position on the board that is not yet taken.
- Once a player makes a move, that move is displayed on the board in the position that they have chosen.
- A player is deemed the winner as soon as they have 3 of their moves either registered in a row, column, diagonal or cross diagonal.
- In the event that no player has won and the board is full, that game is registered as a Draw.
​
## How to play the game
- Enter your name and press enter, you will be assigned a symbol as soon as you enter your name, take note of your symbol.
- Make a move by entering a number in the range [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] which corresponds to a position on the board you intend to move to.
- Make sure the position you're choosing has a number **not a symbol** of the player.
- After each move your symbol will be displayed on the board in the position you choose.
- Keep making the moves until when one of you wins or a draw is reached if all moves have been exhausted and there is no winner.
